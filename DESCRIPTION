Description: A shiny-based user interface for the climex package is provided for both local and server-side application. Using a leaflet-based interactive map, the user can select among a large number of different station data, view summary statistics of the individual stations, or color their positions according to the corresponding return levels to peek at a more holistic picture of the extreme value analysis. In a second tab all the different settings involved in both the fitting of the GEV or GP distribution and the preprocessing can be altered persistently.
