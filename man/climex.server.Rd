\description{
Server-side part of the \code{\link{climex}} function.
}
\details{
Since it grew organically most of the features are
  defined inside this function. Okay, why did I decided to define
  the climex.server and the climex.ui function? Since in this way
  I can provide a local and a server side variant of the code
  which is maintained in the same place. I do not really like the
  idea of installing the newest version of the code from Github
  and than copy/pasting the code in some files somewhere in
  /srv/shiny-server.
