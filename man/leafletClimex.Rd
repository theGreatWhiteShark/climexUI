\arguments{
\item{input}{Namespace input. For more details check out
\url{http://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/modules.html}}

\item{output}{Namespace output.}

\item{session}{Namespace session.}

\item{reactive.chosen}{Reactive value containing a list of the
list of all provided stations and a data.frame containing the
meta data.}

\item{buttonMinMax}{Character (radio) input determining whether
the GEV/GP distribution shall be fitted to the smallest or
biggest vales. Choices: c( "Max", "Min ), default = "Max".}

\item{radioEvdStatistics}{Character (radio) input determining
whether the GEV or GP distribution shall be fitted to the
data. Choices: c( "GEV", "GP" ), default = "GEV".}

\item{sliderYears}{Numerical (slider) input to determine the
minimal length (in years) of the time series to be
displayed. Minimal value is 0 and maximal is 155 (longest one in
the DWD database), the default value is 65 and the step width is
1.}

\item{reactive.extreme}{Reactive value returning a list containing
three elements: 1. the blocked time series, 2. the
deseasonalized time series, and 3. the pure time series.}

\item{reactive.fitting}{Reactive value containing the results of
the fit (\code{\link{fit.gev}} or \code{\link{fit.gpd}}
depending on radioEvdStatistic) to the blocked time series in
reactive.extreme()[[ 1 ]].}

\item{sliderThreshold}{Numerical (slider) input determining the
threshold used within the GP fit and the extraction of the
extreme events. Boundaries: minimal and maximal value of the
deseasonalized time series (rounded). Default: 0.8* the upper
end point.}

\item{fit.interactive}{Function used to perform the actual GEV/GP
fit. \code{\link{fit.interactive}}}

\item{cleaning.interactive}{Function used to remove incomplete
years from blocked time series or to remove clusters from data
above a certain threshold. \code{\link{cleaning.interactive}}}

\item{deseasonalize.interactive}{Function used to remove
seasonality from a given time
series. \code{\link{deseasonalize.interactive}}}

\item{extremes.interactive}{Function used to split a time series
into blocks of equal lengths and to just extract the maximal
values from then or to extract all data points above a certain
threshold value. Which option is chosen depends of the
radioEvdStatistic. \code{\link{extremes.interactive}}}

\item{selectDataSource}{Menu output in the sidebar. Since this
function should only be triggered when selectDataBase equals
"Input", this input will be a character string describing the
selected station's name.}

\item{checkboxIncompleteYears}{Logical (checkbox) input
determining whether to remove all incomplete years of a time
series. This box  will be only available if
input$radioEvdStatistics == "GEV" and else will be NULL.}

\item{checkboxDecluster}{Logical (checkbox) input determining
whether to remove all clusters in a time series and replace them
by their maximal value. This box will be only available if
input$radioEvdStatistics == "GP" and else will be NULL.}

\item{selectDeseasonalize}{Character (select) input determining
which deseasonalization method should be used to remove the
short-range correlations from the provided time series.
\code{\link{deseasonalizeSelectionInput}}}

\item{sliderBlockLength}{Numerical (slider) input determining the
block length used in the GEV flavor of extreme value theory. On
default it is set to one year.}

\item{selectDataBase}{Character (select) input to determine the
data source. In the default installation there are two
options: c( "Input", "Artificial data" ). The first one
uses the database loaded at the initialization of the climex app
(see the \code{\link{climex}}). The second one allows the user 
to produce random numbers distributed according to the GEV or GP
distribution. Determined by menuSelectDataBase. Default =
"Input".}

\item{climex.environment}{Environment containing the global
variables used within the climex app. Namely the last values
displayed in the table and the lists containing the station
data.}

\value{
Reactive value holding the selected station.

\description{
Leaflet interfaces to select stations or visualize
  spacial information.
}
\details{
This module provides an interactive map to display the
  locations of the individual stations. The user can choose
  individual stations by clicking at them. In addition a dialog
  will pop up telling the stations name, the length of the
  time series and the 20, 50 and 100 year return level calculated
  with the setting in the basic map without station positions        
  select only those stations in Germany with a certain minimum
  number of years.
