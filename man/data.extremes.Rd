\usage{
data.extremes(reactive.selection, radioEvdStatistics, sliderBlockLength,
  sliderThreshold, checkboxDecluster, deseasonalize.interactive,
  selectDeseasonalize, selectDataBase, buttonMinMax, extremes.interactive,
  cleaning.interactive, checkboxIncompleteYears)
}
\arguments{
\item{reactive.selection}{Reactive value providing a time series
of class \pkg{xts}. \code{\link{data.selection}}}

\item{radioEvdStatistics}{Character (radio) input determining
whether the GEV or GP distribution shall be fitted to the
data. Choices: c( "GEV", "GP" ), default = "GEV".}

\item{sliderBlockLength}{Numerical (slider) input determining the
block length used in the GEV flavor of extreme value theory. On
default it is set to one year.}

\item{sliderThreshold}{Numerical (slider) input determining the
threshold used within the GP fit and the extraction of the
extreme events. Boundaries: minimal and maximal value of the
deseasonalized time series (rounded). Default: 0.8* the upper
end point.}

\item{checkboxDecluster}{Logical (checkbox) input determining
whether to remove all clusters in a time series and replace them
by their maximal value. This box will be only available if
input$radioEvdStatistics == "GP" and else will be NULL.}

\item{deseasonalize.interactive}{Function used to remove
seasonality from a given time
series. \code{\link{deseasonalize.interactive}}}

\item{selectDeseasonalize}{Character (select) input determining
which deseasonalization method should be used to remove the
short-range correlations from the provided time series.
\code{\link{deseasonalizeSelectionInput}}}

\item{selectDataBase}{Character (select) input to determine the
data source. In the default installation there are two
options: c( "Input", "Artificial data" ). The first one
uses the database loaded at the initialization of the climex app
(see the \code{\link{climex}}). The second one allows the user 
to produce random numbers distributed according to the GEV or GP
distribution. Determined by menuSelectDataBase. Default =
"Input".}

\item{buttonMinMax}{Character (radio) input determining whether
the GEV/GP distribution shall be fitted to the smallest or
biggest vales. Choices: c( "Max", "Min ), default = "Max".}

\item{extremes.interactive}{Function used to split a time series
into blocks of equal lengths and to just extract the maximal
values from then or to extract all data points above a certain
threshold value. Which option is chosen depends of the
radioEvdStatistic. \code{\link{extremes.interactive}}}

\item{cleaning.interactive}{Function used to remove incomplete
years from blocked time series or to remove clusters from data
above a certain threshold.}

\item{checkboxIncompleteYears}{Logical (checkbox) input
determining whether to remove all incomplete years of a time
series. This box will be only available if
input$radioEvdStatistics == "GEV" and else will be NULL.}
}
\value{
Reactive value containing a names list of the extracted
 extreme events, the deseasonalized and pure time series. All
  three are of class \pkg{xts}.
}
\description{
Reactive value extracting the extreme event of a time
  series and all input.
}
\details{
First this reactive value will use reactive.selection to
  obtain the time series it shall be working on. Afterwards it
  applies both \code{\link{deseasonalize.interactive}} and
  \code{\link{extremes.interactive}} to this time series. Finally
  it return the resulting extreme events as well as the
  deseasonalized and pure time series.
